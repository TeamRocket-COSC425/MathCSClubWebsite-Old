            We have a student chapter, Maryland Zeta Chapter, of Pi Mu Epsilon founded in May 2001. Every year at the Math & CS club spring picnic, new members are inducted.

          <p>
               A student meeting any one of the following three sets of qualifications may be elected to membership by a chapter. This election shall be irrespective of sex, religion, race, or national origin:

Sophomores who are majoring or intend to major in mathematics, who have completed at least three semesters (4 quarters) of college mathematics including one semester of calculus, who have achieved a straight A record in all mathematics courses taken, and, who are in the top quarter of their class in their general work.

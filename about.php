		<!-- <p style=" background-color:rgba(230,229,227,0.9);">Our club consists of individuals who are interested in mathematics and/or computer science.  However this does not limit the club to those fields.  We have taken trips to such places as NSA and NASA to give students an idea of job opportunities.  Have an idea that you and your classmates want to make a reality? Here is the place to find like minded, highly motivated individuals looking to further their math and computer science career.</p> -->
		Our club consists of individuals who are interested in mathematics, computer science, and working together as a team to solve problems. 
		We are honored to have the Dead Poets Society (DPS) join our organization to help us think in ways we never thought possible.
		Every week DPS generates questions (poems, mathematics, computer science, etc) for members to try to answer.
		We often have fun activities at our meetings such as pumpkin carvings, wiffle ball, bagel math, Pie Day, and much more!
		Don’t forget field trips to places like Camden Yards for the Orioles, or Peaky’s Restaurant for awesome fried chicken.
		Sound awesome? Want more information? Stop in to one of our meetings and/or e-mail cclement1@gulls.salisbury.edu. See you there!
